  [manu {the other blog i like to keep up with, i found him from an interview he did with devastatia in june and while not as off the rails as devastatia hes still a very interesting person and a his site often links other very interesting blogs leading to some sort of never ending rabbit hole}](https://manuelmoreale.com/)

  [superpredator {mind bending images beyond human comprehension. thats all i can say, you have to see it for yourself.}](https://superpredator.zone/)
