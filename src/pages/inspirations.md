[manu {the other blog i like to keep up with, i found him from an interview he did with devastatia in june and while not as off the rails as devastatia hes still a very interesting person and a his site often links other very interesting blogs leading to some sort of never ending rabbit hole}](https://manuelmoreale.com/)

[onzecki {sent me a really well thought out and detailed email about making my site not run like shit which helped my situation quite a lot}](https://onz.ee/)
