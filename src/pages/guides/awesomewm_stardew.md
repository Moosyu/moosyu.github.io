title: "stardew valley doesnt show up on awesomewm but its running"

sometimes if you change stardew valleys settings on awesomewm (and probably other tiling window managers) stardew valley just disappears and on the next launch it plays sound but never pops up

the fix is just changing from floating to tiling mode. it took me 2 hours to do that.
