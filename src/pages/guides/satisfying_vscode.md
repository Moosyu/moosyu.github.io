I know a lot of people don't like these smooth movement things because it steals your ram but whats the point of having 16gb of ram if im only ever using 2% of it. The people who hate the smooth movements are all losers who hate rainbows and will never whimsically run through a field.

To turn on the smooth cursor you're going to need to press ctrl + shift + p and type "open settings" and press "open settings (ui).

In there, search for "cursor smooth caret animation" and turn that on.

That's it.
