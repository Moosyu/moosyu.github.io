i know a lot of people dont like these smooth movement things because it steals your ram but whats the point of having 16gb of ram if im only ever using 2% of it. the people saying this are all losers who hate rainbows and will never whimsically run through a field.

to turn on the smooth cursor youre going to need to press ctrl + shift + p and type "open settings" and press "open settings (ui).

in there, search for "cursor smooth caret animation" and turn that on
