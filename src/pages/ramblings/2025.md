i added little urls at the bottom of comic images, ive been calling them attachments recently so it felt right. i might even add a paperclip for good measure but its late and i honestly cant be fucked messing with svgs being properly aligned right now.

## 09/05/25

new comment widget coming soon hopefully, kind of busy rn though so soon might be like a month away. php is hard.

## 27/04/25

510 line long stylesheet -> 342 line long stylesheet. this must be how elon feels putting all those government employees on the streets.

## 27/04/25

decided to split my styles.css up, little guide for future me:

if its only used in one place, put it in the page itself

if its used in multiple places leave it in the stylesheet

if its used only in one place BUT has a related media query all deals are off and it says inside the styles.css

with this change i also removed the max-width: 50% thing in the panels, originally it was by mistake but i think i like it more this way as they should really be as big as possible always

## 27/04/25

im the first mixed feelings review on yosuba, actively making the world a worse place.

## 26/04/25

renamed reviews to media as they arent really reviews. created empty pages in place as the old reviews pages to redirect any old links to them so it should be fine.

## 26/04/25

i love you google elements menu

## 17/04/25

js makes me feel like im going insane sometimes bc i got to get in a real weird state where js logic is the only thing on my mind to get anything hard done and the moment i lose concentration i have to start all over again because my work is no longer comprehensible. all im saying is if this was like c# of vb.net (i dunno why that decides to hotlink for me markdown is evil) id actually be able to read my code properly. name conventions are also so stupid too but i feel the compulsion to follow them or im gonna look stupid.

## 17/04/25

last night i read a confusing sentence in my headlamp light. a stone woman gives birth to a child at night. does it mean an empty womb brings forth an empty child? empty crying. empty night sky.

## 17/04/25

my chilli plant blew away in the wind now i know how parents who lost their children feel

## 15/04/25

my hatred for [Redact](https://redact.dev/) was recently reignited by my pookie Jon ðŸ˜˜. this shit is so stupid why would you remove knowledge from the internet, pissing off possibly thousands of people who could've used it in order to make a company lose $0.000001??

something pretty cool happened, unfortunately people i know are aware of the url of this site but something cool did happen please trust me.

## 10/02/25

im quite uncertain where i want my site to go visually. i dont like how it looks right now but i dont want to go backwards.

## 06/02/25

skyblock year 400 event ends in a couple hours, i have somehow managed to win only two dogshit prizes, im feeling a divans alloy coming my way. also my cousins pulled up and i guess one of them brought a dead body or something because theres a horrible stench coming from their room which i have to overpower by filling my room with the toxic scent of lynx africa.

## 02/02/25

been getting educated and shit, i dont enjoy it very much.

## 29/01/25

super excited for the real steve harrington to drop crux, been listening to basic being basic on repeat. that an jane removers albums are my most anticipated right now. also pretty curious to see how the new weatherday album will be, i've never listened to their music before but the cover stands out to me, same situation with japanese breakfast and squid.

## 22/01/25

poyo bought me a domain so now i feel obliged to make the site work.

## 16/01/25

i got yog armour !! in other news i started redesigning the site again because i got pissed off. i think i was changing too much so im going to go back to the basics and make just some more subtle adjustments to the current site instead of starting over.

## 09/01/25

got addicted to skyblock again this rework might take a bit longer than expected sorry gang.


## 08/01/25

i lied i decided to scrap everything and go full boring because all this stupid bullshit like comments is a losing battle.

## 01/01/25
