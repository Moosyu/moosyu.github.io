skyblock year 400 event ends in a couple hours, i have somehow managed to win only two dogshit prizes, im feeling a divans alloy coming my way. also my cousins pulled up and i guess one of them brought a dead body or something because theres a horrible stench coming from their room which i have to overpower by filling my room with the toxic scent of lynx africa.

been getting educated and shit, i dont enjoy it very much.

## 29/01/25

super excited for the real steve harrington to drop crux, been listening to basic being basic on repeat. that an jane removers albums are my most anticipated right now. also pretty curious to see how the new weatherday album will be, i've never listened to their music before but the cover stands out to me, same situation with japanese breakfast and squid.
