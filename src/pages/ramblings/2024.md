i got rid of the js code for the neko-tag webring like i did for the rest of them and just replacing it with redirect urls. why did i not do that until now? idk i forgot. anyways that means the only bit of js that i dont control that is being exectuted on my site is from status.cafe which isnt too bad. still, id like to at some point (probably not soon) make my own selfhosted version of it. iirc piclog has its source public so i assume status.cafe does too but even if it doesnt surely it cant take too long if i dont need to worry about creating sign ups or anything if its just for me ??

alr i got rss dates working and i even made it so you can click things in the search and go directly to where they are in the reviews page. id like to optomise my site at some point soon becuase i dont think i should be bordering on 1 second build times. <span style="color: grey">[11ty]</span> <span style="color: #23cd61">Copied 199 Wrote 33 files in 0.95 seconds (v3.0.0-alpha.20)</span> (obv i use --incremental when testing but like still its kind of sad to see).

## 17/09/24

if im being real idk what else to add to my site, i feel like its reached its perfect form at least for its purposes (except eleventy-img intergration but im waiting for stable 3.0 release for that and i need to figure out how to get rss dates working at some point idk). maybe ill think of something else but for now updates gonna probably slow down a bunch. i also deleted the panels page because like really that should just be a folder.

## 14/09/24

stole some code for minifying the css and html. i was gonna use the 11ty image package to optimise the images but i think ill wait for 3 to come out as it looks like its getting a big upgrade and its not that important right now i think. <--- nevermind i just decided to bite the bullet and upgrade <---- never nevermind the image plugin isnt working with imgur so i give up for now

## 14/09/24

over a two hour period some guy sent 50 messages into my comment box, i kind of feel bad for deleting them all because it clearly took effort but also he was clearly like 12 and i dont need 12 year olds talking about cp and shit on my site

## 13/09/24

## 31/08/24

i wanted to join the bucket webring but i read the about page and it said no "hateful content" is allowed. while that is a pretty vague rule i think it would be a bit of a reach to say that my site has no hateful content on it, half my ramblings are just spreading hate online. still gonna give it a shot and pray ig becuase im just gonna assume they mean hate speech and i dont think i got any of that?? im not an ist or a bic of any kind.

## 30/08/24

as you may know (or probably dont) gemini is an alternative to http and its the most stupid piece of shit ive ever heard of. its not like you can build a minial text site on http and and sorry to say but if youre making a site on gemini youre wasting your time because nobody uses it. nobody is ever gonna read your gemini site which is probably a mirror to an http site anyway. same goes with gopher but its even more stifling then gemini. it just feels like a regression and the only people who use it are the same people who refuse to use js on their sites because they are mad that js can let people make trackers, like i dont like trackers but that was just the natural progression, deal with it mf. im aware this will come off very ranting (because it is) but ive had enough of these mental outlaw type guys pretending they living off the grid then hopping on their unmodified androids, straight onto instagram. dont go halfway.

my website at this point is hardly inspired by the web of early 2000s, its just a site lol. not that a mind too much, purposely making my website look like shit wasnt great and yk its a personal website ill do whatever i want.

just saw [thinliquid's](https://thinliquid.dev/) site and im so done how is he so much better than me <-- this was written in a moment of weakness, i know realise i am gods gift to web design and no man stands on my level (also he revamped it and it looks worse now)

## 25/08/24

its crazy that theres no real mal alternative for western comics. the only "good" choice is goodreads and goodreads sucks ass. everything on there is rated 4 and some of the ratings are fucking insane. you mean to tell me solo leveling is rated higher then dorohedoro, berserk and vagabond? piss off. and its not even like i think the mal scores are particularly good either, solo leveling is bordering dorohedoro on there but its just goodreads is so consistent in being shit, probably because 1 - 5 stars is such a trash way to rate things, they should at least have half stars. i also dont like rating in volumes, just let me rate a whole manga at once god damn, id prefer an overall rating and then an option to rate singular volumes, like how on aoty you rate the whole album then you get to rate songs if you want.

## 24/08/24

i knew me being richard stallmans biggest opp had a purpose [(i grabbed these from a tweet by @jbenton)](https://x.com/jbenton/status/1172662964782075905) i highly doubt hes doing this to protect the kids like hes trying to frame it as in the second tweet. hes just a freaky ass mf whos spent far too long in the basement fermenting who doesnt have any kids himself and hasnt been a kid in like 200 years so cant possibly understand parents concerns of not wanting their kids to get legally groomed by some grimy ass mfs that look like him.

## 22/08/24

i tried out arc browser. i didnt really like it, feels more like a gimic browser and the resource usage didnt help. completely unrelated but i wish there were more sites that said intersting things that had an rss feed, my fluent is looking so empty :(

why does youtube keep recommending me these social skills videos. nobody has ever listened to these generic ass videos and actually developed better social skills. you just become a fake impression of someone else. why would an 8 minute video do anything for someone who has bad social skills when like 13 years of school hasnt dumb fuck??

## 21/08/24

idk why people are so hostile to using javascript (i mean not the programming language, i hate it too but just the concept of it). i feel like these richard stallman ass mfs are purposely choosing not to use new technology (and its not even new isnt it like 20)?!? like should you be flexing you have 10 lines of js in your site? i also see people say that and then turn around and embed someone elses application in their site to play music or something. mf you arent not using javascript youre just adding a few degrees of seperation.

## 19/08/24

i am physically incapable of studying for scienece wtf how can i stare at a book for 2 hours and gain no knowledge.

## 18/08/24

i have come to the tragic realisation that my website is hardly like old geocities sites anymore, and kind of from the start. when i first built it i just though "geocities sites look like shit so im just gonna make my site hurt your eyes". that was a pretty surface level look at geocities and considering that was the base of my site i cant really do much about it. i dont think my site is dense enough and as full of as much stuff around every corner like geocities sites. its very uninspired. the javascript amalgamations i have going on probably dont help either. i guess we'll see where this train of thought leads me some other time because i also dont want to just become an imitation. i think maybe its about just adding whatever i want and worrying about if it blows up pcs or fits on mobile screens later.

considering switching image hosts from imgur. id like to self host but i dont have a server and i dont wanna bloat the github project with too many images. i dont really trust imgur not to delete my shits but like im not gonna use catbox i know they say "heat death of universe" on their site but that is probably closer to like 5 years and it doesnt even work in australia.

i just watched [Why The IndieWeb" by briefs](https://briefs.video/videos/why-the-indieweb/). i thought it was really well done. i dont really think a decentralised web will ever be a thing though (sadly). the web is too big for it to revert to what it was when it had a smaller much more nerdy main audience, also the yesterweb died out because it didnt make fat money stacks and as i watch cohost (sidenote fuck you cohost for suspending me i didnt do anything wrong except criticise you) lose [my hopes](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7045283-june-2024-financial) are not particularly high for non surveillance state advertisement techniques.

## 12/08/24

i consider changing the layout like 60 times a day whats going on. honestly not having all the text squeezed into the center of the screen in a little box might make me stand out more from the other neocities type webistes idk. anyways im meant to be studying what the fuck is going on with my life.

## 11/08/24

i keep seeing a sick site and wanting to completely overhaul mine to look like theirs because it looks "too generic". idk if thats the case, the main layout of most things has stayed the same since ~2021 when i used a w3school tutorial to get it done so i suppose it could look generic but i think its fermented enough to have formed its own kind of identity?? idk, i keep feeling like the navbar isnt bullshit enough but in the same vein the top of the screen horizontal navbar has been adopted everywhere for a reason i guess. though i cant lie i feel a little jealous when i see melps' or incessantpain's cool ass navigation menus.

## 26/07/24

forgot to ramble in a month too busy eating ass and sucking toes sorry. also why do so many of these geocity clone sites have manifestos, they must wanna be the unibomber so bad. its fine but like im evil and hate everything so when i see 500 people write the same fucking 10 page long manifesto am i meant to not be a dick?? these are the hard hitting questions. anyone whos using neocities or alternatives (nekoweb and such) already know that the internet has become a shithole digital version of times square but with isis executions instead of homeless people pissing on the sidewalk. screaming into an endless circle jerk isnt gonna actually change anything. this isnt to say that i know the real answer to the modern internet being "bad" because there really isnt an answer. as the internet became not something just for nerds, websites that were more simplified and easier for the average person to use naturally became the most popular, and once youre the most popular and have as little competition as many websites you can just do whatever the fuck you want. so unless youre elon level wealthy you guys are really not gonna be able to do shit about it.
