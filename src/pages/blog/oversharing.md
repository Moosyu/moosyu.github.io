title: "Oversharing on the internet"

Shockingly, I too (used to be?? am??) pretty prone to oversharing online though as I've gotten older I feel like I've shared less and less, except for in this site ofc especially in the ramblings page but im fairly sure nobody is ever going to link this to me irl so I'm not too worried. Speaking of oversharing like five minutes ago I saw an insane ass comment exchange on albumoftheyear.org so I felt the impulse to create this blog post. Here is the exchange in question:

Posting about how you attempted suicide on a musical review site is an awful idea, simply don't, its an insane amount of oversharing to do and you're almost 100% going to get dogged on for posting something like that. The first reply was just reciting the song lyrics to benadryl submarine by Lil Ugly Mane, which while pretty rude and out of pocket probably should have been expected.

I get that when you're like 13 and have no friends posting your deepest darkest thought to whatever social media you use most feels like a good idea but best case scenario nothing happens, but people on the internet don't care and are evil so things can pretty easily get out of hand. Just don't take any risks, go to a school counsellor and get your issues sorted out. I know this contradicts me saying you should share your deepest darkest thoughts on a website you made but even that might be better than sending it out on a social media page as it closer to just screaming into the void.

This isn't specific to that one person I just feel like I see this happen a lot (way too often on AOTY specifically for some reason? Maybe its just the high autism ratio or something idk) but it never turns out well. Anyways now that I've finished writing this up it seems the like original poster of that review got bullied into deleting it which to be honest is a net positive for everyone including them. Though this post just goes to show once something's out on the internet you cant really delete it. 

Pretty short blog post I know but I really don't have that much to say about this, I'm no professional mental health person and I know its harder to see the answer to situations when you're the one in it but I think resorting to talking about it on social media is always the worst choice and if you ever see me make a post like that just know that I've been killed and replaced by a skin walker. moral of the story therapy is better than being bullied to death by internet people.
