dnis, they exist, i dont like them. there are some of the most stupid things ive ever seen alongside the robots.txt file, assuming putting a line of text at the top of something is going to stop anyone who wanted to do something has never worked ever. you might say that having a dni doesnt hurt anyone but i have to disagree with that, every dni you write takes up like 50 bytes, that takes energy, and your energy contributes to global warming, so when we all die because the sea level rises over every house im blaming you guys.

i have the unfortunate fate to see a dni everyday because i live on the gay side of the internet for some reason and i think the gay people and fan fiction venn diagram is basically just two circles on top of each other so dnis just naturally spread out from there ig (i think they originated from fanfic sites but dont quote me on that). for an example heres a dni which is basically what they all are like:

```
swerfs, terfs, proship, radqueer, transmed, anti-lgbt, racist, prolife, conservative, anti-semitic, ableist, lgbt fetishizer, race-fetishizer.
```

lets do some good old fashioned english class dissecting of this, firstly just blocking people who have different opinions to you is kind of stupid, by turning your life into an endless circlejerk youre being just as close minded as the conservatives you seem to hate so much, and also no conservative at all?? im a massive libtard myself but that doesnt stop me from befriending people with differing political views and values? i just cant imagine centring my life around my political stance and cutting off half of the world by doing so. i get not wanting to talk to pedophiles, anti trans people or racists but like if someone who was actually in one of those groups actually wanted to say something hateful to you, im sorry but this warning is not going to stop them, this is only going to make people who were potentially interesting not end up talking to you.

id also like to talk about a few of these terms, [terfs](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/terf) is the same as anti-lgbt so idk why its here, anti-lgbt is just broader. [proship](https://www.michigandaily.com/arts/proship-versus-anti-fandoms-new-terminally-online-discourse/#:~:text=So%2C%20what%20is%20a%20proshipper,creating%20fanworks%20of%20this%20nature.) is just a dumb term to use at all, be more specific, say pedophiles and pro incest people or whatever, its just needlessly complicating things. [radqueer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLGBT/comments/16fpruz/comment/k03liki/) is a stupid term made by stupid people and used by nobody ever to define themselves ever, theres no point adding it at all. [transmed](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01968599211040835#sec-2) shouldnt even be a term at all because it seems to just be an argument that should be solved by phycologists not people on the internet. im fairly sure [prolife](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/pro-life) falls under conservative ([swerfs](https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/swerf/) might too and i honestly cant see how you'd ever end up in a situation where someone being a swerf matters at all) so no point adding that if youre gonna be a dick and add conservative anyway. thats all i have to say, im on discord at memecompanies if you feel the urge to yell at me about how stupid i am and how i'm anti-lgbt for saying this stuff even though im just as much as a sissy liberal as you guys, just less terminally online.
