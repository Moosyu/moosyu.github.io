linux is my favourite OS, i like it quite a lot and yet i usually run windows 10 because linux is still tragically incapable of doing various things that i need. mainly i use windows 10 becuase programs i need for school cant be used on linux though. still waiting for the day libre office works well enough with word documents to actually be able to use it. gaming on linux used to also be a restriction but thanks to my beloved valve you can basically play every game worth playing and they generally run just as well or sometimes even better than on windows. i would like it to be easier to pirate things too but i doubt valve is gonna help me with that, my only hope is johncena141 (my goat).

the best feature and main reason people use linux though is control. i like having complete control over my OS and the ability to brick my pc if i choose to. the main OS i use is arch (btw) but if im being real with all the install scripts and tutorials arch isnt even that hard for a beginner to get the hang of now, gentoo is much more of a flex. while i mainly use xfce which isnt particulary great for ricing i have dabled in ricing a few tiling window managers (bspwm, i3, awesome and dwm) and i feel like i can safely say awesome is my favourite. it just feels a lot easier to customise then the other three because unlike bspwm and i3 is programming in a real language my beloved lua and unlike dwm i dont need a degree in astrophysics to make it work. like i wasted almost five hours getting nowhere with dwm, hated it.

this is the first one i made and its basically just some slight changes on the [copland theme](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats/tree/master/themes/copland) which is actually the base for all three of these because it just looks so cool !!

when i get back into ricing i want to use a floating wm because im a lot more comfortable with them. im pretty torn between either icewm, worm or openbox but im a leaning a bit towards openbox. side from window managers though theres just so much cool stuff you can use to customise your device on linux, gtk makes it so much more easy to give every app the same theme, command line is still way better than windows and its just way more fast then windows (especially 11) which has more bloat than OS.

if you havent used linux before i highly recommend trying it out, even if you dont end up liking it its still a pretty good learning experience the whole way through, my favourite distros are void, arch, fedora and mint but mint the best beginner distro imo.
