Linux is my favourite OS, I like it quite a lot and yet I usually run Windows 10 because Linux is still tragically incapable of doing various things that I need. Mainly I use windows 10 because programs I need for school cant be used on Linux though. Still waiting for the day libre office works well enough with word documents to actually be able to use it. Gaming on Linux used to also be a restriction but thanks to my beloved Valve you can basically play every game worth playing and they generally run just as well or sometimes even better than on Windows. I would like it to be easier to pirate things too but I doubt Valve is gonna help me with that, my only hope is johncena141 (my goat).

The best feature and main reason people use Linux though is control. I like having complete control over my OS and the ability to brick my PC if I choose to. The main OS I use is Arch (btw) but if I'm being real with all the install scripts and tutorials arch isn't even that hard for a beginner to get the hang of now, Gentoo is much more of a flex as it is the best current way to waste your time. While I mainly use XFCE which isn't particularly great for ricing I have dabbled in ricing a few tiling window managers (BSPWM, i3, Awesome and dwm) and I feel like I can safely say Awesome is my favourite. It just feels a lot easier to customise then the other three because unlike BSPWM and i3 is programming in a real language (my beloved lua) and unlike dwm I don't need a degree in astrophysics to make it work. Like I wasted almost five hours getting nowhere with dwm, hated it. Patching is such a pain in the ass.

I tried to make this one look like [Luke Smiths'](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz) dwm build.

This is me trying out a nord style because I thought it was cool idk.

This is the first one I made and its basically just some slight changes on the [copland theme](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats/tree/master/themes/copland) which is actually the base for all three of these because it just looks so cool !!

When I get back into ricing I want to use a floating wm because I'm a lot more comfortable with them. I'm pretty torn between either IceWM, Worm or Openbox but I'm a leaning a bit towards Openbox. Side from window managers though there's just so much cool stuff you can use to customise your device on Linux, GTK makes it so much more easy to give every app the same theme (though making a theme for GTK sucks), command line is still way better than Windows and its just way more fast then windows (especially 11) which has more bloat than OS.

If you haven't used Linux before I highly recommend trying it out, even if you don't end up liking it its still a pretty good learning experience the whole way through, my favourite distros are void, arch, fedora and mint but mint the best beginner distro imo.

I did try out Openbox but I didn't end up enjoying it as much as XFCE mainly because it was a pain to find a nice bar.
