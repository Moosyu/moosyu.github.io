This is just going to be a quick rant, working on a bigger post but I'm a lazy bum so it's taking a little while. I also made the brave choice to use proper grammar because I wanted to look less homeless.

Anyway, fan service is super common in most shounen manga, manhwa and especially manhua. I'm sure it makes the horny 12 year olds buy your comics and I've read the Comick comment section, I know the primary audience is, despite that I'm still going to complain about how it's just really annoying to me to waste often a full page on an ass shot during an action scene which is so fucking common, looking at you Leviathan. Like are you guys aware that porn is a thing?? I didn't come here for this so why are you giving me it?

I'm fine with the girls wearing skimpy outfits but I'm done with this fire force bullshit where the girls' clothes burn off completely except for a single piece of fabric just barely covering them leaving me unable to suspend my disbelief, I straight up couldn't watch fire force because I couldn't get emotionally invested in it at all. I also despise the stupid ass armour that's basically just dominatrix gear, like what the fuck will that protect you from?? I see some people say that it's for mobility but if you want mobility I'd just be fully naked because when your armour consists of just shoulder guards and cover the bare minimum of your chest area your attackers are still gonna be able to get your vital organs?? It's even more egregious in manhua where there is often more softcore porn then actual content though I don't really care about what manhua does any more because I'll never be reading it anyway (except for the BL manhua which is generally well written probably because they couldn't prop themselves up with scenes of the MC spanking random women for no reason).

I don't know if this goes both ways as the shoujo art style is too bad for me to read and shoujo manga though at least if there's a fight and a guy gets his shirt torn off the artists doesn't need to make the fabric somehow cover his nipples. That's all I had to say, stay tuned for my Wizard 101 blog post which will be coming out 2025.
