I see lots of people complaining about the Nekoweb Discord, which is a little sad because it is my favourite public Discord server of all time. Unironically. This isn't going to be a very coherent blog post and you should probably take it with a grain of salt because I am totally part of the teenager squad [Cereza](https://cereza.zone/) complained about but as someone who will disturbingly be able to vote in the upcoming (New Zealand (least important country on Earth)) election surely my mind is developed enough to comment on things I see and have an opinion of them.

The Nekoweb Discord has let me speak to the largest concentration of deeply interesting and completely off the rails people I've ever had the (dis??)pleasure of having known in my life. I know it's beating a dead horse at this point but Cereza, despite being shockingly bad at taking any criticism even if it was a black and white fact, was a super interesting person to talk to/yell at and I can say the same thing about most people there even if I doubt many think the same of me. I don't mean to dehumanise anyone but sometimes looking into Nekoweb is like looking into an ant farm and staring down a bunch of interesting specimens more than talking to real people and I think I prefer it that way. A server that is properly moderated and stays always on topic like something my beloved [Layercake](https://layercake.nekoweb.org/) suggests is a server I have 0 interest in being a part of.

Many people seem to take Discord far too seriously sometimes. I know it's a bit of a cringy, edgelord, why so serious thing to say but it's true. If you take everything said to be serious or are unable to decipher sarcasm of course you're not going to enjoy yourself. Even if the person saying it is dead serious, why be actually angry about something that matters so little? Maturity is not a word I'd use to describe the Nekoweb Discord, not by a long shot, but I enjoy immaturity a lot more than people always having deep discussions and shit as I'm not particularly mature myself. I'd probably partially chalk this up to cultural differences, Americans specifically, on both sides of the political spectrum (though a huge amount of people in Nekoweb seem to be pretty hardline Libertarian leftists) seem to have extremely polarising beliefs that they love talking about, as well as absurdly thin skin when anything not completely aligning their beliefs is mentioned. Another likely reason for the abnormally large amount of screaming and yelling is the amount of (young)(like 13yo - 15yo) autistic people in Nekoweb who seem to struggle quite a lot with sarcasm as well as figuring out the intentions behind messages. Just not a lot of neurotypical people are into the indieweb it seems. Not to say that I don't enjoy all the screaming and yelling, in fact it's probably my favourite part but I think people need to take a more "no hard feelings" approach to their arguments for them to be at all productive though Discord arguments aren't known to be very productive regardless.

If you've read this whole thing firstly I pity you, but if you're my age or older, you've likely realised I lack a great deal of wisdom. I imagine I'll look back on this in a few years and shudder thinking about this, so if you've taken any offence, please don't as you're already likely a better man then I. I might even wholeheartedly agree with Layercake's post by the time I have a long white beard Santa style, but until that day comes I'll continue to only view public Discord servers as a source as unserious entertainment and I think I like it more that way. In conclusion I give the Nekoweb Discord five stars as well as 10 big booms:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 

💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥

Final note: if you want to vent about something without being judged by others don't do it in a public Discord cmon guys write in a journal or talk to irls or something 😭😭😭.
