you might have noticed if youre more literate than the average commenter on my home page but i like to type in all lowercase will little to no punctuation. this is going to be a pretty short post though as the reason is rather obvious, its just straight up easier. things like apostrophes on most words serve little to no purpose and anyone with a grasp above first grade level should still be able to read what i write so whats the point in adding them?

a lot of people online also seem to type in the same way as me which is why im calling it now, i reckon the english language will eventually evolve to a point where my way of writing is the common way (or devolve i guess). im no linguist or historian or anything but i did go to highschool and was forced to learn some history about the english language and it just makes sense for the path for it to go is the one with the least resistance. this is all assuming the english language lasts that long and we arent all speaking mandarin in three years.

there are still points where it makes sense to me to use normal grammar, separating we're from were, commas and full stops to make a sentence flow correctly and or to indicate ownership with an apostrophe. but it just seems silly to waste my time with useless capital letters at the start of every sentence. i saw a reddit post about capital letters sucking and a response was:

-Makes it clear a new sentence is starting, making it quicker and easy to read

im sorry but if you cant tell if a sentence is starting from a full stop maybe youre just dumb. i dont know why my language must be this was to cater to stupid people who cant read. 

thanks for coming to my ted talk, heres how i build my sentences:

-full stops only if im writing multiple sentences

-apostrophes only if there is another word thats spelt the same but doesnt have an apostrophe

-capitals only for indicating tone (not for proper nouns or starting sentences)

-commas stay the same

it would also be nice if exclamation marks and question marks could be at the start of sentences to set the tone right away like in spanish but not upside down and just finish with a full stop because its quicker than a question or exclamation mark. in fact if we could take a few more spanish words that would be nice too, writing y instead of because would be awesome. if we could take o instead of or that would be nice too.
