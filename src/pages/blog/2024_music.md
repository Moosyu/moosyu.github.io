Ni hao ma squad, as the music recaps are starting to come out I've decided that the year has bascially ended. I'm still waiting on Kanye, Carti and The Weeknd to drop but lets be honest they aren't going to, and even if they do it's probably gonna be mid. I'll put my Spotify recap on this page when they send me it, but for now here's the best and worst of this year. I'm only putting down one thing per artist and due to me not listening to a lot of dogshit my worst lists may be flawed. Great job to Charli xcx for dropping one of the best and one of the worst albums this year!
