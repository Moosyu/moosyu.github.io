reading manga is one of my favourite hobbies, second only to maybe playing games (yeah i dont get out a lot why do you ask), but my third favourite hobby is complaining so this is gonna be a culmination of all i love i guess. by the way when i say manga fan in this im specifically about weebs, not the average well adjusted (in comparison to weebs) anime or manga fans. it also may seem hypocritical to complain at all as looking at how ive read ~300 manga you could probably make the argument that im a weeb, and that argument would probably be correct. but i wouldnt exactly say im obsessed with the genre, nor am i obsessed with japan or its culture. in fact i think japan and its culture suck ass and id rather go to america than have to live in that shit hole. also when i say manga in here i also mean manhwa and manhua.

anyways as ive spent so long reading manga ive unfortunately had the displeasure of needing to interact with other manga fans and as i read through less legal sources the general manga fan i meet is closer to a manic lunatic then a normal person. weebs online are some of the most horny people on planet earth only rivaled by 40 year old divorced dads and rappers, not gender specific either, you would not believe some of the shit ive seen on some yaoi stuff. for a kind of funny example heres the top comment on a chapter from asura scans (hell on earth btw):

note: even if this image is ironic and its just flying over my head this is just the funniest one i could remember, there are a massive amount of people who act like this and im pretty doubtful that they are all being ironic.

aside from their insane level of horniness (which is probably due to the average age of people reading this stuff being like 14 lets be real) ive just seen them take some of the horrendous takes in my entire life. i dont know how it happened but what seems to be the majority of people reading on sites like comick are just straight up homophobic, which seems a bit counter productive as gay people are just increasing the amount of women that they could scare away with their powerful odors but who knows. far less importantly, they also just seem to rate a lot of things way too high, like look at every tierlist on r/manhwa (as a sidenote the mods banned me from that because they hate people having opinions) but these lists have like the lowest tier as D with like 4 items there and 30 times in S+. ?? ? for example heres the first list i saw and like i get that opinions are subjective but also like how you gonna make a list where the majority is in S tier.

my other thing i gotta rant about is scanlation groups which i guess is also just part of the community but its too late to change it editting is for losers who arent always perfect like me. anyways for some reason a bunch of these groups are set up like cults for some reason, join the asura scans discord and the first thing you get put into is a channel where you just praise the asura staff not to mention all the meat riding that goes on in the comments. im not saying they arent doing hard work but like groups like asura are paying people for their translations so i dont think they live off praise like other groups. imagine you went to mcdonalds and 50% of the people getting their food are bowing down on their knees to the teenager at the register.

now my other gripe with scanlation groups is their comments, like i swear to god some of these guys have a comment on every scene and its just annoying, like could you guys fuck off and let me get invested instead of saying "oooo" with a silly emoji or talking about how much you want to bang the highschooler in the scene, like holy shit chill out the 2d women are not gonna let you hit. i know i could just not read them but sometimes they have actual context or say that they changed a word to make it more accurate (which is kind of a pain in the ass too just keep it as the orignal) so like what am i meant to do??

heres a tierlist of manhwa scanlation groups and the reasonings thats been sitting on my hard drive for like 3 months and i just need to get rid of it, if youre wondering why there is no S tier is because none of the manhwa groups are as good as my goats over at kennel club their TL of the wizard and the red pilgrim was incredible.

a:

webtoon [slower than scanlation groups but top of a because they have generally very high quality scanlations, redraw sfx and most importantly reading from webtoon is supporting the manhwa creators. i don't like being forced to use an app or paying for faster chapters but it's worth it imo.]

reaper scans [slower then asura but best tl quality in my experience. my only issue was their scan of god of blackfield, it was good but those mfs keep making tl and pr notes being thirsty over high schoolers, and that really took me out of it.]

flame scans/flame comics [basically just slower asura but i like their translations slightly more, their comment section is less insane, their discord isn't set up like a cult and they don't have as many obnoxious watermarks.]

asura scans [fastest high quality translations in the game. i don't like how they sometimes change the names of things but at least they tell you when they do. bottom of a tier because their watermarking can get really obnoxious and take me out of the story sometimes especially on the lazy lord masters the sword.]

b:

hivetoon/voidscans [high quality tl and generally fast. small watermarks that are semi-transparent. they've (accidentally) left out pages in the past though.]

rizz fables/realm scans [only series i read from them is return of the war god but they are very good at what they do. big watermarks that are less transparent and sometimes in the action weigh them down though.]

zeroscans [good tl in my experience but they are pretty slow just like their website which blows up my phone for some reason. i don't remember them having any watermarks too.]

mm-scans [pretty good tl (in eleceed at least). they have a pretty large non transparent watermark which sucks but i think they make up for it by being so god damn charming (i really like the after chapter messages).]

yellow duck scans [very new group but their tl quality has been pretty good so far. they recently decided to make their own website and stop uploading their stuff onto mangadex which is a bit annyoing but i guess it's just one more bookmark.]

c:

arven [generally readable but often has issues with pronouns which make it seem like a mtl without a proofreader though this seems to have gotten better in recent times. their watermarks are nice and small and don't overtake action. no clue why they are trying to fight asura flame and reaper for solo leveling: ragnarok though.]

nightscans [fast but sometimes shoddy tls with non transparent watermarks that sometimes cover action or text. readable though.]

leviathan scans/ls comic [pretty good tl's and that's about it. if they just stuck to that i'd give them a very solid b but, their discord is apparently a shithole and their website is so filled with adds that you straight up can't use it without and adblocker also for some reason they seem to have pivoted to pornhwa recently which is fine and all but at least give me an option to only see sfw stuff especially after removing all of their stuff from mangadex.]

d:

immortalupdates [pretty bad tls in my experience but not as bad as lua, in actual tl quality they'd be in about c, putting them in d because i've seen them hold chapters hostage until they get sent enough money to release it on player and that's a dick move. i also don't like their annoying ass t/ns especially when something important's happening.]

lua scans [often almost unreadable tls with names and pronouns often being wrong. they also snipe and add 500 non transparent but thankfully small watermarks a chapter.]

f:

manga demon[snipes contantly, has shit translations which must be mtl and have no proofreader because names of things change randomly from chapter to chapter, steal tls from other groups that they put up on their site and ironically then complain about aggregator sites stealing their chapters so they upload half chapters.]

manhwa freak/freak scans, utoon and astra scans [from what i've heard these three are all all under the same ownership and it really shows. trash translations, holding chapters behind paywalls, 50 million credit pages per chapter (which i don't even know why are there because a toddler could do what they do), constantly sniping series, more watermarks than text, like some chapters have two watermarks side by side for manhwa freak and freak scans. your the same fucking website. freak scans is just a redirect to manhwa freak. what the fuck is going on. they also randomly censor shit to get more ad money. astra scans randomly become an aggregator site too, like they hardly translate anything and just steal from asura and the official tl and still fuck that up by having 144p quality images.]

to end my ted talk im gonna show you some beautiful pictures of cooking i stole from some discord server idk
