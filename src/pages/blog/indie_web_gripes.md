as a massive fan of the indieweb, i've spend a long time, far too long in fact, scrolling through random pages and jumping through webrings to look at cool pages, and its awesome. i really like it. you never really know what youre gonna find and its often a very pleasant surprise, but since its hard to write words about things i like im just gonna be complaining about what i dont (who saw that coming).

the #1 most annoying thing is the stupid ass autoplaying music and having too many sound effects in general. like i dont want to turn autoplay off because it breaks some actual cool things like housepens atmospheric rain, but for some reason most sites just use it to blast some max volume shitty dubstep, blowing out my eardrums instantly. im gonna just not go on your site if i start hearing loud autoplay music. it sucks and please stop.

i also absolutely despise [melonking's](https://melonking.net/) stupid [site closer](https://forum.melonland.net/index.php?topic=1502) and [leaky homepage](https://melonking.net/free/software/flood) scripts. it just feels like you dont want me to see your site? im not spending a minute getting the water out of your site and listening to the loud ass sound effect it plays everytime i click it, im just going to leave. same goes with the site closer, its not like most sites have things they need to moderate or anything, they just add it to be quirky i guess. its always a pain too, i either just wasted a couple seconds and leave to never come back or if your site has a download or information i need now i have to wait a day to get what i wanted. if you do this, go fuck yourself and then go die.

    catbox must have deleted the video (so sad) it was a guy saying go fuck yourself and then go die you didnt miss out on much.

video hosted on catbox because the original is age restricted and i dont want my assets folder to grow any larger. hopefully one day ill find a site not run by pedophiles to host these things on.

the only other particularly annoying thing i can think of right now is the massive amount of manifestos, talking about how social media and the algorithm ruined their lives and we have to return to the stone age so we can have normal conversations with people because our lives are controlled by the algorithm. i think thats a stupid cope made by stupid people who lack a basic level of self control to stop scrolling tiktok for two seconds. maybe just find a hobby you enjoy or something? dont blame your unhappiness on technology you chose to use, there are so many other problems you could blame it on. heres a list i made off the cuff:

* global warming
* ai stealing your job
* housing crisis
* rising house prices
* whatever the united states president has done
* racism still being alive
* women being underpaid in the workplace
* unemployment
* wars
* political corruption
* ageing
* decling birth rates
* refugee crisis
* deforestation

pick as many as you want.
