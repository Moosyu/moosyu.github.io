I was feeling extra egotistical this morning and when I stared my website in the eyes and as it stared back at me I saw a flawless masterpiece. The indie-web is kind of split into three columns, sites that are made as an art piece, sites that are made to house content and sites that are shit due to being neither artistically pleasing as well as having no content. When I made the newest iteration of my site, I just decided to make every page look similar so it has some coherence, knowing that there is no way I'm going to ever make a good artsy website like [y2kid](https://y2kid.xyz/) or something.

I think my website is practically complete at this point, I'm sure I could change the layout and theme once a week like some people. Sidenote, its really annoying when your entire website is constantly changing, like sometimes I go back for inspiration and its just an entirely knew design. Personally though I'm pretty happy with what ive got going right now. It's easy to add stuff and it's pretty fast too. It even looks alright imo (compared with my old site). Here's a screenshot of the old one btw:

It was perhaps more unique and creative but it was slow, annoying to navigate as like half the pages had entirely different layouts and it was a real pain to work with, especially making sure mobile works. I know indie-web people try to sound cool and pretend they chose not to make their site work on mobile but I reckon its probably because they can't. Either way, apparently 90% of the people on the internet are on mobile so its fairly important which is why ive invested a little time into making sure my site works on mobile, which is why it does. The only issue I have on mobile is that the reviews table is really small but like really what can I do about that.

Everything I need to do at this point is probably not going to change the experience for anyone using my site, just make it easier for me to work on my site. The only visual change I'm intending is to somehow make the flaming titles generate at build so every page has its own custom flaming text instead of some of the pages just having the same generic reviews one, or the same psudeo blog one. not sure how I'm going to get that to work though so it might be a bit. I also just realised I went completely off topic and just made this about my website but I guess it makes sense as if you want the perfect website you're looking at it.
