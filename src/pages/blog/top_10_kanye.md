I didn't know where to put this so fuck it this is a blog post now. I didn't think through any of the descriptions of the songs its just off the dome as you could probably tell so just go listen to the songs instead.

## #10 Addiction

One of the most underrated Kanye tracks and the best from late registration, it's very dark but it's played off as silly and I think it gives you a real look into Kanye's mindset which I imagine has only gotten since this point.

## #9 New Slaves

One of the least Kanye Kanye songs, very experimental, hard hitting and the beat switch is crazy. It also has a sick ass ending which really solidifies it as one of his best.

## #8 Jesus Walks

This is what a Christian song should sound like, it's not preachy (I mean it's a bit preachy but not nearly as much as most of the Christian songs I hear) it's just beautiful and very uplifting. I'm not even Christian either it's just that good, fun for the whole family.

## #7 Through the Wire

This song goes even harder with the backstory, this mf had his mouth wired shut! (I know he re-recorded and played it over but still). This is also a great example of storytelling in music and I wish there was more stuff like this out there.

## #6 Homecoming

Best song off Graduation I'm not sorry this is so much better than I wonder, it's so upbeat and I love that its all a metaphor, its also really funny that Chris Martin from Coldplay is on here and even more funny that he kind of cooks.

## #5 Life of the Party

I'm gonna be really Andre 3000 absolutely carries this track, Kanye did fine and the beat is great but Andre's verse about his mum is just on another level, idk why Diddy had to be on here though. The music video for this is also horrifying.

## #4 Ghost Town

Ye might be the most underrated Kanye album and this song is the best off ye by far. This track is insanely emotional and honestly gives off similar vibes to runaway which you may have noticed by now but I like a lot.

## #3 Devil in a New Dress

Rick Ross carries on this one, his best verse of all time and its not even a competition. Looking at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone is the best opening line ever put to paper.

## #2 No More Parties in LA

People have got to talk about this more because it's incredible and somehow Kanye manages to pull off a better verse than Kendrick. Kendrick, Madlib and Kanye being on the same song and all giving it their 100 is never gonna happen again.

## #1 Runaway

I know putting this in #1 is perhaps a bit cliche but its not my fault its the best Kanye song, in fact this is the best song from the 2010s and that's the same decade TPAB, Igor, The Money Store, VOLCANIC BIRD ENEMY AND THE VOICED CONCERN and so much more came out. I think this is the most genuine hes ever been on this song. This is the most Kanye it gets.
