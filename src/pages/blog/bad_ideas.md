Over the past week I have been faced with the insurmountable task of created a blog post that has both more than three lines of text while also having more depth than one of those AI Youtube shorts that just explain whats going on in the video as if I don't have eyes. Everyday as I enter whichever shitty RSS reader I'm using that week, that's somehow still worse than fluent-reader which I would use but it just doesn't run for me and its too hard to figure out, I'm inundated with so much bullshit to read that has no value to anyone, perhaps not even the person who wrote it but still somehow entertains me. That's the purpose I hope for my blog to serve at some point to someone. That goal has lead me to be forced to delete 1000 word rant about how david bowie isn't respected enough, as even I don't want to read all that during proofreading.

During my endless scrolling, which is eerily familiar to doom scrolling through Youtube shorts but my mind has been tricked by internet men telling me reading blogs is better for you, I also sometimes find gems hidden amongst the coal, posts from people who don't post anything for a year then come out of nowhere to write an extremely detailed and informative post about how using Linux and a printer is going to get me hacked. I hope one day I will be blessed with more than a thirty minute attention span and be smart enough to write something of that quality, but last time I asked to be blessed with something god gave me a 36% on my maths final so my hopes aren't high.

To end this wordy but overall meaningless piece of slop I'd like to say that I hope one day ill be able to look back at my blog and see thousands of posts, an extension of my younger self who was unburdened by things like a mortgage and a failing marriage, so I hope to post on here at least once a week. That future is pretty unlikely to happen though, both because the odds of me ever affording a house even with a mortgage are almost non existant and because inspiration comes and goes, I doubt I'll be able to keep this going as long as someone like manu who I imagine is going to continue posting until the end of both his natural and unnatural life but I can surely hope for $\frac{1}{100}$ of his power. To be able to scroll down for full seconds through my list of posts would surely be a nice thing to see, I at least want enough that you'll need to scroll to see all the blogs on the main page.

Rereading this, this shit sucks I don't know why at 11:30 I thought myself to be a writer or something, but this is dogshit. I'd be shocked if anyone reads this.
