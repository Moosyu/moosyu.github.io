if youre someone who cares about trigger warnings dont read this, in fact if you are then please leave my site thanks.

i just saw a crazy ass comment thread that i feel the uncontrollable need to share because its not every day i get to read something this fucking stupid. the people involved in this are Hahahahaisofke (who im gonna call haha) and yurisrarity (how im gonna call yuri), yuri makes music and is trans, idk anything about Hahahahaisofke aside from the fact that they used to be tight with yuri. [if you want to read the whole thread instead of listen to some guy commentate over it click here.](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/hahahahaisofke/album/1074420-/)

the reply thread starts with yuri rambling schizophrenically to themselves, or perhaps someone else said something and it ended up getting deleted. im a bit late on this. the first part doesnt really make sense, i imagine because im an outsider but then haha makes the insane comeback "You are a racist groomer". spoiler warning!! that does seem to be true.

yuri calls him salty and haha drops a bunch of info, btw addy is yuri's (ex) girlfriend who was barely 15 when yuri was bordering 18 and im fairly sure their relationship started when addy was 14 due to some of the messages later. some people wouldnt find this age gap that bad, but i think those people are fucking stupid and ive never seen a situation when a 15 year old was nearly mature enough to be in a relationship with someone that old. ofc age gaps matter less and less the older you get but at that age three years can be massive. btw the 15 year old making rape jokes and saying slurs doesnt really matter to me, like its kind of corny to still be trying to be an edgelord at that age but yeah i dont really care or think its nearly as bad as the other things, though i should say while i havent confirmed this haha told me yuri used to be in a discord server called "neetcord" where they identified as a nazi which is about what i expected from a server called neetcord. i think kellen is part of addy's friend group.

yuri comes back with some really dumb replies, not denying anything and just attributing dating someone three years their junior to being edgy.

then haha comes in with an even more insane accusation only for yuri to admit it too??

afterwards haha indirectly confirms for the random people reading at home like my ass that he does in fact know yuri personally.

by this point other people start noticing this now like 25 message long thread, yuri's explanation to ghostminus was this:

"ghost minus this thing i said This person is very mad because i stopped being friends with them so just ignore that and the person i dated lied to me about their age for months and we only had contact online i already talked about that and had my mom prove that she lied about it as well as we broke up before i even turned 18 and i was on and off talking to them for a while because i felt bad for them but we ended up breaking it off anyways because it was just never gonna work and i wasnt comfortable after they lied abt their age and we have no contact also the racist shit is bullshit i ignored people after they said the nword and didnt block them to not start an issue but if that makes someone think im problematic its ok i had to learn my lesson and learn to not trust random people online"

firstly i should mention by now that yuri types like they are illiterate for some reason but thats neither here nor their, they said that ghostminus understood but ghostminus never even replied so that might just be cope. they also talk about "context" but its still on you if you fell for a 14 year old pretending to be 16, you might just be stupid.

next up my goat haha goes off the rails and starts trying to focus in on the n word and rape jokes which is clearly not the most important thing going on but alright, he does make a good point though as in yuri's message to ghost minus they said "i ignored people after they said the nword and didnt block them to not start an issue" which is immediately proven wrong. then we get to know why yuri blocked haha in the first place, which was predictably for a reason that makes yuri look even worse, haha was blocked because he told yuri to stop stealing their moms meds. insane. then yuri fucks themselves over even more by hammering in that they have not in fact blocked addy in order to not "start beef" with this 15 year old.

yuri proceeds to try to defend themselves but those messages seem to be gone but from what haha says it can be assumed that they were just excuses, excuses so bad i guess they had to be deleted. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2yVpJhM.png)

yuri then says their only good comeback, because yeah im pretty sure haha is only criticising them for doing these things that they knew were going on after being blocked.

at this point the conversation starts going in circles with messages that just boiled down to haha saying something and yuri just doing nuh uh but it is kind of funny that haha got robbed by yuri.

yuri does a classic self own and continues trying to blame everything on them being edgy.

haha starts to go off and yuri just seems to give up realising they are destined to lose.

then a bunch of people come in and defend yuri which is so fucking stupid and honestly perfect evidence that aoty users really dont care about this stuff as much as they pretend to in a dogshit attempt to virtue signal. thats the end of my ted talk, god bless you whoever just read all this shit. obv my opinion holds no real weight but i found reading this pretty entertaining so i dont care.
