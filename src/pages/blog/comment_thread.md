If you're someone who cares about trigger warnings don't read this, in fact if you are then please leave my site thanks.

I just saw a crazy ass comment thread that I feel the uncontrollable need to share because its not every day I get to read something this fucking stupid. The people involved in this are Hahahahaisofke (who I'm gonna call Haha) and yurisrarity (how I'm gonna call yuri), Yuri makes music and is trans, idk anything about Hahahahaisofke aside from the fact that they used to be tight with Yuri. [If you want to read the whole thread instead of listen to some guy commentate over it click here (Yuri's account was deleted so this a saved version of the page).](/pages/misc/comment_thread_save/)

The reply thread starts with Yuri rambling schizophrenically to themselves, or perhaps someone else said something and it ended up getting deleted. I'm a bit late on this. The first part doesn't really make sense, I imagine because I'm an outsider but then Haha makes the insane comeback "You are a racist groomer". Spoiler warning!! That does seem to be true.

Yuri calls him salty and Haha drops a bunch of info, btw Addy is Yuri's (ex) girlfriend who was barely 15 when Yuri was bordering 18 and I'm fairly sure their relationship started when Addy was 14 due to some of the messages later. Some people wouldn't find this age gap that bad, but I think those people are fucking stupid and I've never seen a situation when a 15 year old was nearly mature enough to be in a relationship with someone that old. Of course age gaps matter less and less the older you get but at that age three years can be massive. Btw the 15 year old making rape jokes and saying slurs doesn't really matter to me, like its kind of corny to still be trying to be an edgelord at that age but yeah I don't really care or think its nearly as bad as the other things.

Yuri comes back with some really dumb replies, not denying anything and just attributing dating someone three years their junior to being edgy.

Then Haha comes in with an even more insane accusation only for Yuri to admit it too??

![](https://I.imgur.com/W8zwg7k.png)

After Haha indirectly confirms for the random people reading at home like my ass that he does in fact know Yuri personally.

By this point other people start noticing this now like 25 message long thread, Yuri's explanation to ghostminus was this:

"ghost minus this thing I said This person is very mad because I stopped being friends with them so just ignore that and the person I dated lied to me about their age for months and we only had contact online I already talked about that and had my mom prove that she lied about it as well as we broke up before I even turned 18 and I was on and off talking to them for a while because I felt bad for them but we ended up breaking it off anyways because it was just never gonna work and I wasn't comfortable after they lied abt their age and we have no contact also the racist shit is bullshit I ignored people after they said the nword and didn't block them to not start an issue but if that makes someone think I'm problematic its ok I had to learn my lesson and learn to not trust random people online"

First I should mention by now that Yuri types like they are illiterate for some reason but that's neither here nor there, they said that ghostminus understood but ghostminus never even replied so that might just be cope. They also talk about "context" but its still on you if you fell for a 14 year old pretending to be 16, you might just be stupid.

Next up Haha goes off the rails and starts trying to focus in on the n word and rape jokes which is clearly not the most important thing going on, but alright. He does make a good point though as in Yuri's message to ghost minus they said "I ignored people after they said the nword and didn't block them to not start an issue" which is immediately proven wrong. Then we get to know why Yuri blocked Haha in the first place, Haha was blocked because he told Yuri to stop stealing their mums meds. Insane. Then Yuri fucks themselves over even more by hammering in that they have not in fact blocked Addy in order to not "start beef" with this 15 year old.

Yuri proceeds to try to defend themselves but those messages seem to be gone but from what Haha says it can be assumed that they were just excuses, excuses so bad I guess they had to be deleted. 

![](https://I.imgur.com/2yVpJhM.png)

Yuri then says their only good comeback, because yeah I'm pretty sure Haha is only criticising them for doing these things that they knew were going on after being blocked.

At this point the conversation starts going in circles with messages that just boiled down to Haha saying something and Yuri just doing nuh uh but it is kind of funny that Haha got robbed by Yuri.

![](https://I.imgur.com/qXTHNzz.png)

Yuri does a classic self own and continues trying to blame everything on them being edgy.

![](https://I.imgur.com/HzSc6Ge.png)

Haha starts to go off and Yuri just seems to give up realising they are destined to lose.

![](https://I.imgur.com/U8Garq9.png)

Afterwards a bunch of people come in and defend Yuri which is so fucking stupid and honestly perfect evidence that aoty users really don't care about this stuff as much as they pretend to in a dogshit attempt to virtue signal. That's the end of my ted talk, god bless you whoever just read all this shit. Obv my opinion holds no real weight but I found reading this pretty entertaining so I don't care.

Uhh update like an hour after this post, surely not a good sign but I actually got in contact with Yuri. 

They said a bunch of stuff, like multiple paragraphs and here is some of it.

![](https://I.imgur.com/zIGSTYg.png)

They said this about the neetcord server I'm not sure if I buy this explanation as why would you stay in it for three days, but since there's no proof I've seen either way I'll just have to trust as yeah it would be quite silly for a trans person to be part of a group that hates their kind and I might just be retarded for thinking that one was real and not a joke, gonna delete it from the original section of the post.

Apparently Haha was/is a "North Korea defender," which, if true, is really funny. It just seems like Yuri and Haha are both just shitty people.

![](https://I.imgur.com/SYabpcF.png)

Yuri also confirmed the very sketchy 3 year age gap bit which like really how do you fall for a 14 year old pretending to be 16 when you're 17?? 

![](https://I.imgur.com/tcyL14y.png)

Following that though Yuri also made a claim against Haha which yeah it's completely fucked to harass someone's family no matter what they do imho.

In conclusion I think my opinion of Yuri has slightly grown and my opinion of Haha has massively shrunk though I still think Yuri's mad weird and perhaps malicious for how that relationship went down and the idea of someone stealing the medicine their mother needs to survive just because they are a druggy is honestly horrible and unforgivable, which is something they never even seemed to mention in their messages to me.

All the replies from the previous update are now hidden, idk if this is something they did themselves or moderation doing it but that's just how it be, I saved most the replies as screenshots here though so it doesn't really matter. Their about tab also says "waiting for acc deletion, thank you for the support while I was here." now, idk if they just added it though or if its been there forever.

Not really related to anything just interesting and it tracks.

Ok Yuri's account is gone now. Idk if they deleted it themselves or got deleted by the mods though. Good riddance either way. I also found some doc that Yuri made about it, I don't know how I didn't read this soon ig I'm brain damage but you can click [here](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/2cfdb51d-24df-44f5-8fe8-5a0cfa0cbe75/downloads/87b7cd02-80e8-4862-85d3-c472ce4b4e0b/Document.pdf?ver=1728347863397) to read it.
