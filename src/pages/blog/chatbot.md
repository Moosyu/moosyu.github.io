title: "AI still sucks ass and it can't write good stories"

Note: this is like totally unedited and I wrote it like a month ago but that's the state of my site right now, so idk just don't read it.

Over the past few months I've been trying and then proceeding to get very disappointed by a variety of AI chatbots. When I was a young lad I was a big fan of those choose your own adventure story books and I felt like these would be that but better, yet somehow they are in many cases not only less legible, but also give you less choice??

I've been using Janitor AI which while it is mainly a porn site with various bots written by people who don't actually know how to speak English, it also has some RPG bots which sparked my interest. Sadly using one of these RPG bots is more just assisting AI in writing a generic fantasy story rather than being part of a fantasy world yourself. On every single RPG bot, no matter what I did the story always ended up boiling down to:

- Random group of adventurers is either way too nice to you for no reason or way too mean to you for no reason

- Fight monster

- Power of friendship saves the day

- Get raped (depending on how your wrote your persona)

- Have every woman and man on the planet throw themselves at you

- The AI forgets what's going on and just turns into endless sex compilation with no other elements

This isn't due to lack of trying, I've tried so fucking hard to make it work and while you avoid getting raped with the OpenAI LLM you also avoid almost all violence because OpenAI hates fun. Janitor LLM on the other hand lets you fight things but it is so unbelievably horny that unless you are being very very careful to reroll whenever something slightly resembling affection happens you'll end up being hunted by hordes of sex pests. I'd pick a limited bot but those are often so watered down it's just sad.

AI is a lot better at doing stories between you and one character, but a big problem in that department are the people writing these bots. These are not professional writers, I wouldn't even call a large amount of them literate. They also seem unable to characterise anyone which leads to paper thin bland characters that revolve entirely around the user.

Even when you find a character that is written by someone who passed 2nd grade English you still have to religiously update the AI memory if you want the character to have some semblance of context because it doesn't ask for context if it doesn't have it, it just makes shit up. It's the text version of that AI Minecraft that teleports you when you stare at the ground. Not to mention neither OpenAI or JanitorAI seem to have the capabilities to create a character that can argue back without repeating the same thing over and over. Drama bots are hardly worth your time as they are either completely forgiving of anything you do or insane people who would shoot someone dead for bumping their shoulder.

Another issue is that the world bends with you, you can't push against the Chatbot because it's not solid, it will bend. No matter what you do, if you push hard enough the Chatbot will just agree and let you do whatever. This might seem like a non-issue but it's a really immersion breaking when you do something stupid and the bot just follows along with you and keeps going to where it was originally, like playing one of those games where you have multiple choices but each choice is leading to the same ending.

My last major issue is that due to AI chatbots being used almost entirely as an alternative to porn, most of the bots are written as extreme stereotypes of their gender with the horniness at it's highest possible by someone of the opposite gender with little to no nuance from one character to another. Talking to a different bot very often just feels like the same experience with a different coat of very thin paint. This is except for angst bots who instead of being horny are deeply hateful and the only way to get them to talk like normal people is to kick their ass and then apologise for kicking their ass which makes the bots do a:

*I've never been apologised to before! Maybe this guy isn't so bad after all.*

Perhaps I'm doing something wrong and it's not like I've played every single bot, but I've played a fair few, too many even and aside from one or two bots that I managed to get a fairly decent story from by babying them and editing almost every message, I've been unimpressed. AI cannot write interesting stories yet and I'm feeling like it's going to be many years before it reaches such a point which is very disappointing as their potential is crazy.
