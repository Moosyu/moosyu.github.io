i just read [joosh's review on the airpods max](https://joo.sh/journal/apm2024/) and it inspired me to steal his idea and do a review on my favourite headphones, the panasonic rb-m300b wireless headphones. if you wish to read a more legible and interesting review please read jooshs instead, i know next to nothing about anything so this is just words strung together without substance.

## things i like

* probably the most important thing for headphones is sound quality and its pretty great. ive never actually had any supremely expensive headphones to compare these to but i still think they sound great and thats all that matters. 

* the bass on here is also great, one time i was just laying on the couch and [there is no food](https://open.spotify.com/track/30j2ZsXF9MpdbDrCwYwPNk?si=7dfa06822433462a) started to play and the bass blew my ear drums out and it was awesome.

* these things have so much battery life, like its almost unbelievable. i literally go weeks without charging these things only to find they're still at like 20% battery, its honestly quite incredible.

* there is no setup on these, they just work which is a nice change of pace from a lot of my other peripherals which require me to download some shitty electron app to operate them.

* they are very comfy, they make my ears feel good and they dont have that weird leathery material that makes my ears sweat like on my old razer headset.

* these things are super cheap, i got my pair for only $99 nzd and considering the quality that's a steal.

## things i dont like

* just a general problem with wireless headphones but its kind of annoying to lay down with these on and my only real option is to turn it to the point i look like some kind of cyborg.

* bluetooth sucks, not the headphones fault but it always feel like bluetooth is fighting me and has no idea what to connect to not to mention bluetooth fucks the audio quality when the mic is being used?? i dont even know how this happens but its annoying and it sucks ass.

## things i dont care about

* there is no noise cancellation on these things, that might be a deciding factor for some people but as someone who can only hear 12,000 hz and below it doesnt matter because the padding blocks all the outside noise i can hear anyway.

in conclusion aside from my bluetooth headphones using bluetooth they are great and i love them, hears a picture of my beautiful boy:
