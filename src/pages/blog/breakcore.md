First blogpost btw !!

My first time hearing any breakcore was like a lot of people, I got "Mr. Kill Myself" recommended to me on Youtube and if I'm being real I thought it was alright.It wasn't aggressively bad like most of Sewerslvt's shits but I still found it a little bland. I then forgot about Sewerslvt for like 3 years until I started to really get into music.

When I first started actively seeking out good albums and listening to new genres my main source was online forums and aoty. I heard quite a bit about the album "[we had good times together, don't forget that](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/423966-Sewerslvt-we-had-good-times-together-dont-forget-that.php)" and I heard it was the greatest breakcore album so I my expectations were pretty high.

It was pretty intriguing but due to brain damage I decided that, to get the full context and impact I would first need to listen to everything else Sewerslvt has ever made (tragic mistake). I first listened to [Don't Be Afraid of Dying](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/210944-Sewerslvt-dont-be-afraid-of-dying.php) which turned out to be the worst album I have ever heard in my entire life. Every song was an endless barrage of boring, repetitive and offensive music made by someone who sounds like a 13 year old edgelord but was somehow 17. The titles spell out Junko Furuta. Why? Just to be edgy I guess, which continued for this entire album. The first fucking song has a 911 call from a little girl who just found her brothers corpse. This album is so disgusting and tasteless for no reason. Doesn't help that the production sucks ass and not a single song actually sounds good. 0/10

Next up was [It Just Gets Worse](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/527178-Sewerslvt-mortem-it-just-gets-worse.php). The title is a lie though as you can't get worse than a 0 but it's not much better either (still got it). It's just ass. It's boring and put me in a bad mood, listening to this made me want to have a cold shower to wash off all the shit. That's about all I have to say which is still a bit more than this album had to say, also apparently Sewerslvt dropped the n word in the intro but that's neither here nor there. 2/10

[Interdimensional Snuff Films](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/424080-Sewerslvt-interdimensional-snuff-films.php) had a cover I liked. It seems like a lot of people online were starting to like her stuff by this point too, I can't tell you why though because even if this was an improvement it still wasn't good music. The only reason I sort of liked this album was because it was just remixes of far better songs that Sewerslvt ruined.  3.5/10

[Starving Slvts Always Get Their Fix](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/159853-Sewerslvt-starving-slvts-always-get-their-fix.php) was an album I straight up forgot about, it's just that boring. It wasn't as bad as any of Sewerslvt's earlier works but it was just so mid I had to check and make sure that the discogrophy I was looking at was real because I had no memory. Due to that I cannot tell you much about this one except that I rated it a 4.5/10 at the time I heard it.

[Drowning In The Sewer](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/159852-Sewerslvt-drowning-in-the-sewer.php) is shit and I have no idea how it hit a 7 on aoty. this is a regression back to It Just Gets Worse. It's so all over the place and has no idea what it wants to be and yet doesn't have a single good song on it? I could not tell you why people like this. 3/10

[draining love story](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/206300-Sewerslvt-draining-love-story.php) is actually fine. It's not good but its pretty easily the best album she's made compared with everything before this. It had a decent atmosphere and its kept my attention for longer then the 2 seconds the rest held me for. It's not interesting though and its not like I'm ever going to return to it but maybe its a 5.5/10

[The World Is Fvcked](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/310606-Sewerslvt-the-world-is-fvcked/) was another regression. It was just slightly too bad to listen to as ambience but when I actually focused on it I just wanted to turn it off. It should have been like 15 minutes max. 4.5/10

[Skitzofrenia Simulation](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/374737-Sewerslvt-skitzofrenia-simulation.php). No improvement since the last one. It's not worse either but just as forgettable. I guess it was trying to have some more heavy sounds and less ambience but it didn't do anything for me. 4.5/10

[we had good times together, don't forget that](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/423966-Sewerslvt-we-had-good-times-together-dont-forget-that.php) was Sewerslvt's best work. If I'm being real this album had a lot of strong moments and I had a pretty good time with some of it especially "self destruction worldwide broadcast" which is easily the best track Sewerslvt ever made. Apparently Sewerslvt was trying to get deep here though and I just wasn't feeling it. This is like crying bart simpson profile picture core for fake depressed 13 year olds where a lot of the stuff that was meant to be emotional just came off as weepy and dull. It was also way too long (an hour 30) for no reason at all, lots of fat could have been cut off this.

My thoughts on the new albums under the name Cynthoni are dogshit and trash respectively.

I also went through all this without mentioning that Sewerslvt (the person) aside from making some of the most boring music ive ever heard is also not suprisingly an awful person. I'm just not gonna touch on in here because if I'm being real I barely know the lore and can't do it justice and it doesn't really matter. it is funny to see all the reddit people cope about it thought. in conclusion some people should just kill themselves and Sewerslvt is one of those people. this is not a joke about suicide its a suggestion. if you actually want to listen to some good breakcore go listen to turquoisedeath.

Just listened to the new Cynthoni album and it was just more of the same, very mid.
