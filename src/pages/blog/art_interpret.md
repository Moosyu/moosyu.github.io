I recently saw a review of the album "Monarch of Monsters", this is the second paragraph:

This is likely the stupidest take I've ever read on AOTY so far and it got my blood boiling so much I couldn't restrain myself from writing this post, I'd have told the author my thoughts but it seems I'm blocked despite having never even interacted with them in my life. My main issue with this review is that it's reductive to the art itself, how should one person on the internet decide the "correct" way to interpret someone and just hate anyone else who doesn't agree. If the artist did indeed only expect someone to view their art in one way then they aren't very good at what they do.

It seems like they're so heated about this because the album is about abuse and that seems like a sore spot for a lot of terminally online autists but being so closed-minded about anything just because it hits close to home is just going to put you in an endless circlejerk where actual meaningful discussion can never be achieved as you've blocked anyone who wanted to do that (yes I'm salty). That's not even to mention that people were saying freaky ass cover with absolutely 0 context of anything to do with the album as it couldn't even be listened to on anything but Apple Music for a day so dismissing people who hadn't even had a chance to "truly examine and study art" is so silly.

Art should really be up to interpretation, if someone finds comedy in what you find hits differently, great. You both enjoyed it can have a discussion about what caused your differences in opinion. If anyone is immature it's someone who is so bad at handling any opinions different to theirs that they have to block anyone who has such an opinion.
