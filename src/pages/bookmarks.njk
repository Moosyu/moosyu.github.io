    <p>Big unorganised collection of software, mods, websites and anything else that I'd have saved in my bookmarks bar.</p>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Another big icon library. Very clean website, used it to grab the icons from the Noto Emojis set because it's just a lot faster this way. Also lets your edit the SVGs which is pretty cool when you just need to do simple things like rotate or flip.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Site that lets you easily upload images and dither them with lots of customization possible, no ads, no annoying requests to sign up. I've used it for the background of my site personally.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Slow but a genuinely brilliant site saving decades of internet history. Pretty helpful to go back to old versions of sites I like to get some inspiration or to read old posts from sites that no longer exist. Shocking that a service like this is free.</span>

                <span>Don't really use this much anymore but when I was really going for that old Geocities vibe I was grabbing gifs from this pretty often. A bit slow (as all things relate to IA are) but very charming and a cool way to get a 90s aesthetic for your webpage.</span>

                <span>Codepen but instead of yelling at you to sign in it just lets you do your thing. Collapsing sidebar requiring pro is the dumbest shit I ever heard though ðŸ˜­.</span>

                <span>Being able to reverse image search in all the reverse image search sites at once in a couple clicks is great but honestly these days I use this tool more for just grabbing images when for whatever reason the site blocks you from grabbing it. Feels wrong to not have it installed.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Saving Youtube from itself. A feature I'd grown to rely on more than I thought and I don't want to let it be taken away from me so easily. I know it's sometimes inaccurate because it's an estimate based on how much users of the extension dislike but it's accurate enough for me.</span>

                <span>The extension not the pen, terrible name I know. Just a really simple way to edit the CSS of sites without any extra bloat I don't need. I finally can free myself from seeing comments on ComicK and it's wonderful.</span>

                <span>All I need in a password manager, sync with my other devices, password generator and it just makes me feel more secure than using a browser's built in password manager though I'm not sure if that unfounded.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>My favourite browser right now, everything I like about Chromium without everything I hate about it. Has a built in adblocker that works just as well as uBlock in my experience and even if it didn't Brave still supports manifest v2 so I could just use uBlock if I wanted. Only thing I don't like is the weird crypto integration but you can disable that in a minute so it's not a huge issue imo.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>MultiMC but better (from what I've heard, I've never actually used MultiMC). Probably my favourite alternative launcher, very easy to add accounts, create new instances of Minecraft and add mods to your game. Feels a lot more snappy than the official launcher too.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>MDN docs display a similar list of compatible browsers with a feature but Can I Use goes into more detail and has a wider range of data. Very helpful to quickly check if using something would be viable to do without breaking my site for too many people.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Best torrenting software out because it manages the impossible task of not installing a bitcoin miner on your PC. The UI is nice and easy to comprehend even if you know very little about torrenting as well so that helps.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Huge library of SVGs of... varying quality. If you don't mind digging through piles of trash to find what you want this might be helpful especially for things most people in their right minds wouldn't create for normal icon packs.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Name speaks for itself, lets you grab colour's from images. It has various methods of doing so and lets you paste into the site itself without downloading the image. Only problem I've had with this site is it asking me to download some random ass app a little while ago but it seems to have stopped doing that now.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Site I use for making quick edits to images, usually cropping for the comic reviews page. Being able to just copy and paste in is more nice than you'd expect especially when you're doing it often. Only issue I've had with this site is it breaking on giant images like those you'd find in manhwa but for most normal use it's just fine.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>My favourite SSG (Astro can have second place). Really takes tedium out of working on a site and make automation of many things shockingly easy. Even just having templates so I don't have to update every page or do some weird embed shit when I change the navbar is a huge timesave. It's also a lot less heavy than many of its competitors and I quite like my 2 second build time though it does seem to be less polished than bigger operations like Astro.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Too good to be true honestly. A super easy way to backup your code, view the code of other open source projects, view statistics and even host static webpages like this one (unless you're viewing it on Nekoweb). If you aren't using it you really should be (or at least use a decent alternative like Codeberg though it doesn't have a search function to my knowledge).</span>

                <span>Super useful site for tracking music you're listening to whether you're using Youtube Music, Spotify, Soundcloud or any number of other sites. It also has a nice API which is what I use to display my last played song on the front page.</span>

                <span class="version-subtitle"></span>
                <span>Easy to use and modify comment widget but not exactly a good one. I'm currently using it but it's dead easy to spam and due to how it's set up, running through Google Forms is convenient if you don't want to deal with annoying backend but it's also impossible to prevent spam no matter what you do. If you aren't in my position with a hungry mob of 7 year olds hoping to piss you off it'll work just fine though.</span>

                <span>Speaks for itself and this mod is the only reason I actually build shit because it's demoralising to watch my hard work get turned into dust by decay. Redux version because the original has broken.</span>

                <span>Feels a little like SVE's worse younger brother but I'm sure anything would compared with SVE. Lots of new stuff but definitely feels more like a mod and is more contained to a few areas. Still worth a playthrough of.</span>
