I wasn't really even listening to this album, I was just doing shit and paying it no mind the majority of the time. Did they expect me to take a seat and listen to mysterious sounds for 7 hours straight? This just sounded like one long ass boring song that was intermittently interrupted by whatever sparkles sound like and some guy who sucks ass at yodelling. The only way this 'atmosphere' you guys are going on about is as pronounced as you say is if the atmosphere is me walking through a cold ass street for 7 hours with nothing to do as I slowly lose my fucking mind. Like I was kind of enjoying the atmosphere for the first 20 or 30 minutes but this shit just drains you, I felt tired after listening to this album. It is funny to see the Spotify views drop slowly as people get bored out of their minds listening to this. I think I'm going to get an early night."

It was a boring 20 minute slog where I at multiple points considered just turning the album off and then once it finally ended Revenge Fantasy started playing and that song was ass too üò≠ (not nearly as bad though). It seems like a lot of people got hit hard by this one but I just can't relate, perhaps I'm just a sheltered little whiteboy but this was far too hit or miss for me. By the way, was that a gmod sound effect on PLAY DEAD! PLAY DEAD!? I swear to god it was. When it comes out on Spotify I'll relisten to it and perhaps the pain of giving Tim Apple my credit card will have dissipated and I'll be able to enjoy it fully.

The only low point on this one for me was Warsong and it was barely a low point. We are back team. Edit: 8.8 -> 8.4 This album has grown off me a little.
