Some of the scenes really show their age, basically anything relying on special effects, the entire intro sequence looks like ass and the scene with Saruman and Gandalph fighting with stupid ass sliding sound affects and old man cries was so silly and took me out of it. Also a lot of the moments just feel a little too over the top to make them believable which negates some of the impact the moments could have for me."

I'm not sure if anyone actually watched this show after making it because if they did they likely would have realised just how jarring so many of these scenes are.

It's unbelievably boring and repetitive, I hate every character and even if they are realistic it doesn't change the fact that Shinji is a little bitch, Asuka is just a bitch and Rei is hardly a person who has almost 0 character development. The plot is so complicated and convoluted with a mystery that is impossible to understand without seeing other Evangelion media and forgive me for wanting a series to be able to be digested without going through other movies just to get an understanding of a mystery that should have been answered at the start. No characters ever die, and if they do they are alive in the next episode so I am never worried. The symbolism looks cool but is meaningless and looking cool was literally the entire reason it was added."
