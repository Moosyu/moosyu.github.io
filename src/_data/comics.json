My main issue is that this manhwa has a kind of fucked up start with the previous owner of the body wanting to off himself constantly and everyone around him worried for when he'd try again only for it to just him being a silly guy a few chapters later. Felt like complete tonal whiplash. I'm not sure how realistic it is as thankfully I don't have any personal experience with situations like that but it was still kind of fucked and left a bad taste in my mouth."

If he did he'd have just ran away, he had the power to do that like near instantly. Aside from poor naming though I found that this was alright, the story is pretty nothing but it's murim which is unfortunately my favourite genre and had some pretty heartfelt moments for random murim slop. The art wasn't exactly the norm but it was expressive and didn't feel lazy. The backgrounds have the generic assets that I've complained about before but it's easier to forgive here as it doesn't stand out as much and there are sometimes some hand-drawn assets mixed in."

The characters themselves are pretty generic and boring, strong MC and group of strong quirky friend like angry sword woman, big strong man, they even have a knockoff Pram. I'm not even sure how strong the MC is because he was somehow able to kill a like god in his last life that killed like tens of thousands and then you mean to tell me that he can't use an apparently basic part of swordsmanship? In general its a little hard to gauge power in this story, like how can an attack from the strongest swordsman be blocked by a teenager? The plot is about as generic as it gets too, evil cult wants to destroy the world so MC has to get strong and kill them, not to mention its regression so it couldn't possibly be interesting in the first place when you already know the destination, truly the isekai of manhwa. \n I first heard of this because it was popular on r/manhwa a few months ago which was already a real flag and then found out it was popular on ComicK too so I went in already knowing it was going to be shit, lo and behold it was. I know it's bad to come in with already negative expectations of something but if this manhwa was actually good it'd be able to change my expectations so I don't want to hear any shit. Academy's Genius Swordmaster's real saving grace is that it's so nothing that it can't possibly offend me enough for it to be rated lower than a 3."

The characters aren't over the top, they act close enough to normal people to not get pulled out of the story. I quite liked reading the continued teasing of the MC, it was charming and as normal manhwa comedy is anything but subtle it was a breath of fresh air. The art is very pretty too and the pacing isn't completely fucked in the sense that it's taking time for the MC to become stronger. Quite excited to see how this one pans out (the Webtoon translation has the most dogshit dialogue of all time by the way read the Asura one)."

All I know is one day I wish to reach their level of drip. \n The characters also happen to just be unapologetically cool while still having room to develop which is something a lot of comics, manga especially struggle with. Them kicking ass and having their ass kicked are both equally fun to watch, the fights are great especially later on, some of the best biggest and most explosively fun battles I've ever seen. The world itself is pretty wacky and fun too, maybe it's just because I've read a lot of manga but I haven't seen something like this wild and diverse in characters and world design since I read Saga. My only big issue was sometimes I found the story a little hard to follow, though it may just be due to how illiterate I am. There was just a lot going on though, lots of panels felt like some were's Waldo shit and it was sometimes to the comic's detriment even if it's undoubtedly cool to look at a big ass battle with so much shit going on.

Not a single joke in the entire 96 chapters I read was even funny enough to make me even exhale air. This was mainly because all the jokes are the same joke, Mahiro is in a normal situation and is too much of a shut-in to act normal and freaks the fuck out. It wasn't funny the first time and it certainly wasn't funny the 96th time. The joke about Mahiro getting hard because a little girl touched him landed especially poorly and made me want to blow my brains out and it's a little unnerving to see this character who was meet to be some grown ass man act like a little anime girl maybe that's just me though.\n I also don't really like how this sketchy man is befriending little girls.

It had bad pacing like they said that Mori is changing after knowing him for like 2 weeks and it felt slow and fast at the same time somehow so I probably would have dropped this but apparently after volume 3 the original author left and the artist had to do his job for him, and the artist immediately killed off most of the side characters literally or by turning them into whores. He changed the plot from a sports manga to a psychological manga with climbing as a backdrop to it and the art kept getting better and better and by the final climb it had reached a peak as high as even Berserk and Vagabond in my opinion. The final climb was probably my favourite arc and ending in all of manga and hit so hard not knowing if he would live or die until the very end. I did not move for the entire duration of it. This is peak literally and figuratively (I'm a comedic genius). \n Edit: I went a bit hard on the start of the manga it's not that bad, not that good either though."

Besides that it just comes off at unfocused constantly, it should be focusing on one thing and doing it well but its just trying to do a bunch of stuff shitily."

            "description": "Jumbo don't deserve this disrespect! \n Edit: Are we deadass right now? \n I'm not quite the intended audience for this manga, I find slice of life horribly boring (too shounen brained as I've heard it put) and I despise children, but despite my better judgement I gave this manga a shot because of its absurdly high rating on MAL. After reading four volumes of this I think I can safely say Yotsuba is not for me. \n I might just be some sort of grinch who hates sunshine and joy, but Yotsuba just being happy and enjoying herself wasn't enough to keep me coming back, especially when the humor felt very one note and repetitive, she misunderstands something because she's a dumbass, overreacts and that's about it. Yotsuba being an stupid little kid who overreacts constantly might be realistic, kids are awful after all, but it never really feels like anything was changing. The cast grows but it feels like Yotsuba at the start would be identical to the Yotsuba at the end as she doesn't grown in any meaningful way physically or mentally. This felt a bit off to me as growing is really the only thing kids are good at. \n The aspects that keep this from being a not recommended for me are the side characters and art, I really enjoy the interactions between the supporting cast, it feels like a nice reprieve from the generally mind numbing content of this manga. The art too, while not stunningly beautiful like many of the manga it somehow manages to rank above on MAL (ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡) is very charming and holds up a lot better than many of the other manga releasing during the same time period. Not just that, from what I've seen in the later chapters it's grown a fair bit (though Yotsuba does kind of look out of place sometimes, I mean look at this: https://i.imgur.com/xP6yTbt.png)."

The best aspect of this was the art, even if most character designs aren't super interesting the art for the MC and the monsters is always super cool to look at as well as the huge attacks. I just wish it had a little less edge, the MC cannot catch a break and while it felt alright for a three chapter series just to set it up, when every chapter or two it tells us how much pain he's in or introduces best friends we've never heard of just to kill them off, it feels like a bit much. Aside from the MC being tortured it's a pretty generic gate Manhwa so it gets boring fairly quickly especially when it collapses in on it self about 15 chapters in. I don't know if the author got told he could only make like 40 chapters or something but the pace becomes completely fucked and it gets extremely confusing with random retcons and shit going on. \n Edit 3: I might be going completely schizo so I won't update the score just yet but I think I see a very bizarre vision for this manhwa and I think maybe we're going somewhere.

The art isn't my favourite, but it's unique (to its detriment in my opinion, but still). The MC isn't a huge dickhead which is nice, it's not some overblow OP MC slop either (though the MC is pretty powerful) and the dynamic between him and his master is very charming.

The art is wonderful, whether it be the beautiful handpainted pages or the sprawling watercolour covers they're always a joy to look at.

Watching Musashi contemplate shit is extremely entertaining even if a lot of the Buddhist philosophy seems to right over my head. This manga also flows extremely well moving from chapter to chapter in a way that makes me unable to pull myself from it. All the side characters are super fleshed out and interesting even ones that disappear in just a few chapters. Some people might find backstories in backstories annoying but I don't really mind especially when everything is so well done. Its very unfortunate Vagabond will likely never finish, but I'm fine with rereading it over and over pretending that it'll come back one day. If you're fine starting a story that doesn't have a conclusion please give Vagabond a shot (I'm begging on my hands and knees)."

It looks pretty weird and the colours also just feel a little off, I'm unsure if that was a stylistic choice or just the way the artist likes to draw but it's a little bizarre regardless. The story was alright, I thought some moments felt like the author was pushing a little too far out of his capabilities but at least the author was trying which is something you can't say for a lot of manhwa. The main character's growth is pretty satisfying to watch and I find myself coming back to this every once in a while."

Super cool manhwa, the artstyle is a unique mix of black and white in hell and coloured panels for the surface (it's cooler than it sounds, trust me). The comedy isn't much but it makes the manhwa better than if it didn't have it.
