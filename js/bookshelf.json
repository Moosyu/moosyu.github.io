    "description": "beautiful art and a main character who develops more in a couple hundred chapters then i ever will in my life. the covers and spines are also really cool and unique so they stand out a lot. hardcover copies also sell for only $30 so its not a bad price either, highly recommend."

    "description": "a really good mystery manga that just happens to have a really bad ending unless you read 21st century boys. the perfect edition is really good and definitely better then reading this through scans and the covers are really cool. not a fan of the fonts on the spine but i do like how the spines connect to make an image because i have a stupid monkey brain."
