                <br>
                most i call them "reviews" but they arent really, more like random collections of thought i have after watching something.
                <br>
                the catagories are also pretty loose im grouping the entirety of webtoon into asian media because its just easier yk.
                <br>
                if youre wondering about the rating distribution discrepancies between asian ratings and everything else its because 
                <br>
                since making this site ive having been reading as many books and watching as many movies, so a lot of the ratings are
                <br>
                based on vague memories i have of something from when i was like 7, so they just seem better to 6 year old me ig.
                <br>
                as for video games i usually dont buy games below "very positive" on steam so i just end up rarely playing bad games.
                <br>
                i also rate things before actually finishing them if i just drop them at like chapter 5 lol so if it rated something
                <br>
                like a 4 or below ive probably only read about 20 chapters, but in my mind if it isnt good for 20 chapters it just isnt a good story.
