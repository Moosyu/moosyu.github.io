            <p> 
                the <a style="color: white;" href="https://brave.com/">brave</a> browser: easily the best chromium 
                based browser in my opinion as it is easy to use, comes with an adblocker which was the only thing that could block youtube ads
                for me for a while and an optional crypto thing that lets you get money from watching ads and send it to creators you like
                (i think, i turned it off because ads are a pain) brave is just really cool and basically just a better chrome or edge.

            the <a style="color: white;" href="https://www.gimp.org/">gimp</a> image editor: ever since i stopped using pirated
            photoshop and pixlr went rogue and gave me a download limit, gimp has been my go to tool for image editing. its complicated
            at first but once you get the hang of it, it can be a replacement photoshop and you dont even have to pirate or give those 
            adobe guys $100000 a year.

        <p> 
            the <a style="color: white;" href="https://github.com/fn2006/PollyMC">pollymc</a> minecraft launcher: best minecraft launcher that is currently being made.
            it is a fork of prism launcher which is itself a fork of polymc but has a few changes making it slightly bettersuch as not 
            requiring an account for offline mode (letting you pirate minecraft).

            the <a style="color: white;" href="https://apps.gnome.org/app/io.bassi.Amberol/">amberol</a> music manager: amberol plays music, looks nice
            is easy to use and not over complicated. what more do you want.

        <p> 
            the <a style="color: white;" href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start">thunar</a> file manager: thunar has it all (for me at least), it looks nice, runs 
            quickly enough, isnt too large to download and does everything that a file manager should do. 
            the only reason this is above my second favourite, pcmanfm is because i think it has a better search functionality so it comes out on top.

                the <a style="color: white;" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">firefox</a> browser: though firefox may be a bit slow and not as privacy conscious as other
                options it makes up for it with how easy to use and reliable it is. it also has a large amount of extensions (not as much as chrome) but it has
                all the extensions i could ever need. it also helps that it is larger than a lot of the other options making support for it not hard to come by.
