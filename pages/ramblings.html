      I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.
      
      You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach.
      
      But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.
      
      And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby.
      
      This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you.
      
      For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.
      
      My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you.
      
      I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.
      
      It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.
      
      This ends for all of us.
      
      End communication.

    <p>just saw <a href="https://thinliquid.dev/">thinliquid's</a> site and im so done how is he so much better than me</p>
    <h3>25/08/24</h3>
    <p>its crazy that theres no real mal alternative for western comics. the only "good" choice is goodreads and goodreads sucks ass.
      everything on there is rated 4 and some of the ratings are fucking insane. you mean to tell me solo leveling is rated higher then
      dorohedoro, berserk and vagabond? piss off. and its not even like i think the mal scores are particularly good either, solo leveling
      is bordering dorohedoro on there but its just goodreads is so consistent in being shit, probably because 1 - 5 stars is such a trash
      way to rate things, they should at least have half stars. i also dont like rating in volumes, just let me rate a whole manga at once 
      god damn, id prefer an overall rating and then an option to rate singular volumes, like how on aoty you rate the whole album then
      you get to rate songs if you want.

    <p>i highly doubt hes doing this to protect the kids like hes trying to frame it as in the second tweet. hes just a freaky ass mf whos spent far too long in the basement
      fermenting who doesnt have any kids himself and hasnt been a kid in like 200 years so cant possibly understand parents concerns of not wanting their kids to get legally

    <p>why does youtube keep recommending me these social skills videos. nobody has ever listened to these generic ass videos and actually developed better social skills.
      you just become a fake impression of someone else. why would an 8 minute video do anything for someone who has bad social skills when like 13 years of school hasnt dumb fuck??
    </p>
    <h3>21/08/24</h3>
    <p>idk why people are so hostile to using javascript (i mean not the programming language, i hate it too but just the concept of it). i feel like these richard stallman ass mfs
      are purposely choosing not to use new technology (and its not even new isnt it like 20)?!? like should you be flexing you have 10 lines of js in your site?
      i also see people say that and then turn around and embed someone elses application in their site to play music or something. mf you arent not using javascript
      youre just adding a few degrees of seperation.

    <p>i hate savemyexams and just studying culture shits in general. how you gonna charge me 25 euros to use the only source of information that is actually comprehensive wtf??
      i payed $200 dollars for your stupid fucking course cambrdige maybe put in a little more effort in actually making some educational resources instead of making a syllabus
      and just fucking off for a year.

    <h3>18/08/24</h3>
    <p>i have come to the tragic realisation that my website is hardly like old geocities sites anymore, and kind of from the start. when i first built it
      i just though "geocities sites look like shit so im just gonna make my site hurt your eyes". that was a pretty surface level look at geocities and considering
      that was the base of my site i cant really do much about it. i dont think my site is dense enough and as full of as much stuff around every corner like 
      geocities sites. its very uninspired. the javascript amalgamations i have going on probably dont help either. i guess we'll see where this train of thought
      leads me some other time because i also dont want to just become an imitation. i think maybe its about just adding whatever i want and worrying about if it 
      blows up pcs or fits on mobile screens later.

    <p>considering switching image hosts from imgur. id like to self host but i dont have a server and i dont wanna bloat the github project with too many images.
      i dont really trust imgur not to delete my shits but like im not gonna use catbox i know they say "heat death of universe" on their site but that is probably
      closer to like 5 years and it doesnt even work in australia.

    <p>i just watched <a href="https://briefs.video/videos/why-the-indieweb/">"Why The IndieWeb" by briefs.video</a>. i thought it was really well
      done. i dont really think a decentralised web will ever be a thing though (sadly). the web is too big for it to revert to what it was when it had
      a smaller much more nerdy main audience, also the yesterweb died out because it didnt make fat money stacks and as i watch cohost (sidenote fuck
      you cohost for suspending me i didnt do anything wrong except criticise you) lose <a href="https://cohost.org/staff/post/7045283-june-2024-financial">my hopes</a>
      are not particularly high for non surveillance state advertisement techniques.

    <h3>12/08/24</h3>
    <p>i consider changing the layout like 60 times a day whats going on. honestly not having all the text squeezed into the center of the
      screen in a little box might make me stnad out more from the other neocities type webistes idk. anyways im meant to be studying what
      the fuck is going on with my life.
    </p>
    <h3>11/08/24</h3>
    <p>i keep seeing a sick site and wanting to completely overhaul mine to look like theirs because it looks "too generic". idk if
      thats the case, the main layout of most things has stayed the same since ~2021 when i used a w3school tutorial to get it done so
      i suppose it could look generic but i think its fermented enough to have formed its own kind of identity?? idk, i keep feeling
      like the navbar isnt bullshit enough but in the same vein the top of the screen horizontal navbar has been adopted everywhere for
      a reason i guess. though i cant lie i feel a little jealous when i see melps' or incessantpain's cool ass navigation menus.

    <p>im so fucking sick of needing to sign up to every website. like this is why i need 2fa on everything because passwords dont matter anymore because if i want to do
      anything at all i gotta sign up, wanna crop this image online? sign up!! want to view this document? sign up!! want to scan an image for ai? sign up!! so now, every
      password i have gets breached twice a week because they useless fucking sites have no idea how to safely store information. greatest ad for password managers ive ever
      seen. fuck you isitai.com, ill start scanning shit with my eyes from here on out.</p>

    <p>i missed the wizard101 free week *sigh*</p>
    <h3>26/07/24</h3>
    <p>forgot to ramble in a month too busy eating ass and sucking toes sorry. also why do so many of these geocity clone sites
      have manifestos, they must wanna be the unibomber so bad. its fine but like im evil and hate everything so when i see 500 people write the
      same fucking 10 page long manifesto am i meant to not be a dick?? these are the hard hitting questions. anyone whos using neocities
      or alternatives (nekoweb and such) already know that the internet has become a shithole digital version of times square but with isis
      executions instead of homeless people pissing on the sidewalk. screaming into an endless circle jerk isnt gonna actually change anytihng.
      this isnt to say that i know the real answer to the modern internet being "bad" because there really isnt an answer. as the internet
      became not something just for nerds, websites that were more simplified and easier for the average person to use naturally became the
      most popular, and once youre the most popular and have as little competition as many websites you can just do whatever the fuck you want.
      so unless youre elon level wealthy you guys are really not gonna be able to do shit about it.
