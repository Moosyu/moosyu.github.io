  <p>first blogpost btw !!</p>
<p>my first time hearing any breakcore was like a lot of people, i got &quot;mr kill myself&quot; recommended to me on youtube and if im being real i thought it was alright. it wasnt aggressively bad like most of sewerslvt's shits but i still found it a little bland. i then forgot about sewerslvt for like 3 years until i started to really get into music.</p>
<p>when i first started like seeking out good albums and listening to new genres my main source was online forums and aoty and i heard quite a bit about the album &quot;<a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/423966-sewerslvt-we-had-good-times-together-dont-forget-that.php">we had good times together, don't forget that</a>&quot;. and i heard it was the greatest breakcore album so i had my expectations pretty high for it.</p>
<p>i was pretty intrigued but i guess i have brain damage or something because i decided to get the full context and impact i would first need to listen to everything else sewerslvt has ever made (tragic mistake) i first listened to <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/210944-sewerslvt-dont-be-afraid-of-dying.php">don't be afraid of dying</a> which turned out to be the worst album i have ever heard in my entire life. every song was an endless barrage of boring, repetitive and offensive music made by someone who sounds like a 13 year old edgelord but was somehow 17. the titles spell out junko furuta. why? just to be edgy i guess. the first fucking song has a 911 call from a little girl who just found her brothers corpse. this album is so disgusting and tasteless for no reason. doesnt help that the production sucks ass and not a single song actually sounds good.  0/10</p>
<p>next up was <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/527178-sewerslvt-mortem-it-just-gets-worse.php">it just gets worse</a>. the title is a lie though as you cant get worse then a 0 but its not much better either. its just ass. its boring and put me in a bad mood, listening to this made me want to have a cold shower to wash off all the shit.
thats about all i have to say which is still a bit more than this album had to say anyways. also apparently sewerslvt dropped the n word in the intro but thats neither here nor there. 2/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/424080-sewerslvt-interdimensional-snuff-films.php">interdimensional snuff films</a> had a cover i liked. it seems like a lot of people online were starting to like her stuff by this point too, i cant tell you why though because even if this was an improvement it still wasnt good music. the only reason i sort of liked this album was because it was just remixes of far better songs that sewerslvt ruined.  3.5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/159853-sewerslvt-starving-slvts-always-get-their-fix.php">starving slvts always get their fix</a> was an album i straight up forgot about its just that boring. it wasnt as bad as any of sewerslvt's earlier works but it was just so mid i had to check and make sure that the discogrophy i was looking at was real because i had no memory. due to that i cannot tell you much about this one except that i rated it a 4.5/10 at the time i heard it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/159852-sewerslvt-drowning-in-the-sewer.php">drowning in the sewer</a> is shit and i have no idea how it hit a 7 on aoty. this is a regression back to like it just gets worse. its so all over the place and has no idea what it wants to be and yet doesnt have a single good song on it? i could not tell you why people like this. 3/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/206300-sewerslvt-draining-love-story.php">draining love story</a> is actually fine. its not good but its pretty easily the best album shes made compared with everything before this. it had a decent atmosphere and its kept my attention for longer then the like 2 seconds the rest held me for. its not interesting though and its not like im ever going to return to it but maybe its like a 5.5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/310606-sewerslvt-the-world-is-fvcked/">the word is fvcked</a> was a bit of a regression. it was just slightly too bad to listen to as ambience but when i actually heard it i just wanted to turn it off. it should have been like 15 minutes max. 4.5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/374737-sewerslvt-skitzofrenia-simulation.php">skitzofrenia simulation</a>. no improvement since the last one. its not worse either but just as forgettable. i guess it was trying to have some more heavy sounds and less ambience but it didnt do anything for me. 4.5/10</p>
<p><a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/423966-sewerslvt-we-had-good-times-together-dont-forget-that.php">we had good times together, don't forget that</a> was sewerslvt's best work. if im being real this album had a lot of strong moments and i had a pretty good time with some of it especially &quot;self destruction worldwide broadcast&quot; which is easily the best track sewerslvt ever made. apparently sewerslvt was tryna get deep here though and i just wasnt feeling it. this is like crying bart simpson profile picture core for fake depressed 13 year olds where a lot of the stuff that was meant to be emotional just came off as weepy and dull. it was also way too long (an hour 30) for no reason at all, lots of fat could have been cut off this.</p>
<p>my thoughts on the new albums under the name cynthoni are dogshit and trash respectively.</p>
<p>i also went through all this without mentioning that sewerslvt (the person) aside from making some of the most boring music ive ever heard is also not suprisingly an awful person. im just not gonna touch on in here because if im being real i barely know the lore and cant do it justice and it doesnt really matter. it is funny to see all the reddit people cope about it thought. in conclusion some people should just kill themselves and sewerslvt is one of those people. this is not a joke about suicide its a suggestion.</p>
