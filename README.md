##  website
been working on and off on it for like 3 years or smthing. the codes real messy and all over the place but yk its honest work. a lot of the site is barely hodling itself together though so i wouldnt recommend copying straight code because it will probably collapse in like a week.

shoutout to the fellas at neocities bc im ripping them off real hard.
